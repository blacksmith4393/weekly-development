# Chapter 7 Notes

* It is important to define the right boundaries of objects so that it plays well with it's neighors.
* Three aspects of TDD help to achieve this:
	1. Forces to describe *what* before *how.*
	2. To keep tests understandable we have to limit their scope.
	3. To construct a test we must understand an objects dependencies.
* Value types - It helps to define types to respresent value concepts in the domain.
  	** For example defining and Item type instead of using a String.
* Three techniques for creating value types:
	1. Breaking out
	2. Budding off
	3. Bundling up
